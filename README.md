Regarding past ATS CA projects trading profits (solution performance):

From your CA deliverables, especially in reports "Future Work section (or Defending Our Very Poor Profit Results)" I could see your frustration when facing negative returns, but I saw more of your genuine hard working effort to try to earn money, which is the purpose of CA work/system modelling. All your relevant efforts will be reflected in higher marks, well done!

Although your "smart selective high return" was show to impress, a scrutiny of your methods would suggest a more reasonable negative returns around single to double digit percentage loss (Don't worry, since all systems did badly if not worse =). Many systems used similar references and approaches, which made your results comparable, furthermore, mutually validating/benchmarking each other's numbers (made my life easier too), proving this FCPO is a difficult to earn money case.
